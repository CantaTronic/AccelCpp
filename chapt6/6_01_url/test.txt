If you’re just getting started with tech and are considering being a social developer, we’ve made a documentary training movie for you! Get Involved in Tech(http://www.getinvolvedintech.com/) walks you through ://setting up your GitHub account, exploring StackOverflow, setting up a blog and starting to tweet!
Wondering what someone else’s first contribution was? You can easily find out any GitHub username’s “First Pull Request” here! (I think you’ll:// find that most people’s first PRs were relatively small like Kent’s - http://firstpr.me/#kentcdodds).
We think that open source projects should value civility and kindness and be patient with new developers (http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BringKindnessBackToOpenSource.aspx) and we encourage you to explore projects that have a published Code of Conduct(http://contributor-covenant.org/) and we hope you do too!
