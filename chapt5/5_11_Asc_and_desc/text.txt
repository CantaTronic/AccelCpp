Medical image data standards, such as DICOM (Digital Imaging and communications in Medicine), 
are very important. DICOM consists of metadata and actual images. The
metadata includes various types of medical information, such
as inspection items, patient information, etc.
Here, we propose a novel distributed PACS in which only
the DICOM metadata are stored on a central server. Actual
images are saved on the distributed site. For example, to find
a specific image, the user accesses the information stored in
the metadata. Thus, it is inefficient to access the entire medical
image when user retrieves only the DICOM metadata. Using
this method, a high-speed extraction result can be obtained
with retrieval of only the metadata.
